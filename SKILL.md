# 550W Watermark & Text Eraser

<!-- 550w-capabilities:start -->
## Capabilities and inputs

- Image watermark removal: upload a user-selected image to erase a watermark or unwanted text.
- Local video subtitle and visual-watermark removal: upload a user-selected MP4/MOV video for processing. Erase the full frame by default; use pixel coordinates x1, y1, x2, y2 for a rectangle only when the user explicitly supplies them. Never guess coordinates.
- Video-link watermark removal: ask the user to choose Share → Copy link in the relevant app or platform website and provide the video/content share URL. TikTok and X are examples; actual support depends on the service response. Return the resolved platform-watermark-free video URL.
- If the agent cannot download the resolved video URL or the download times out, give the user the resolved data.video URL to download in a browser. Do not substitute the platform share URL or claim the file was downloaded. Successful resolution and client download are separate outcomes.

## Choose an access route

This Skill offers two independent routes. Installing it does not register MCP, grant file access, or enable script execution. Process only media the user owns or is authorized to edit.

1. Honor the user's chosen route. Otherwise prefer OAuth when the host supports remote MCP OAuth: connect Streamable HTTP `https://www.550wai.cn/mcp/global` and sign in and consent in the browser. Manage connections at <https://eraser.550wai.com/mcp-connect/>. Read [OAuth workflow](references/oauth-access.md); this route never asks for an API key, user ID, or token.
2. If OAuth is unsupported or the user explicitly chooses API Key, explain the alternative and obtain their choice, then read [API Key workflow](references/openapi-access.md). Configure `SUBTITLE_REMOVER_USER_NO` and `SUBTITLE_REMOVER_API_KEY` from the same account at <https://eraser.550wai.com/api/>. If no tools are registered but Node.js 18+ execution is allowed, send JSON on stdin to `node {baseDir}/dist/550w-skill.cjs`, for example `{"action":"queryCredits","params":{"region":"global","locale":"en"}}`. Explicitly set `params.region="global"` on every API Key request; language never changes region.
3. Cancellation, 401, expiry, insufficient credits, or task timeout must not trigger silent fallback. Pin each operation to one route and account. If acceptance is unknown, check the original task before doing anything else; never resubmit through another route. OAuth tokens, API keys, media IDs, and task contexts are not interchangeable.

## Files and results

Both routes include upload support, requiring permission to read selected files and execute Node.js or equivalent host file transfer. API Key uses an absolute `params.filePath`; OAuth uses bundled `scripts/550w-upload.cjs` inspect/upload and remote upload tickets. Read the selected workflow before execution. Never put credentials in command-line arguments, logs, or public packages. A cloud host cannot assume access to a path on the user's computer. If file upload is unavailable, direct the user to <https://eraser.550wai.com/>; a share link is not a substitute for a local video. Share-link cleanup may still be used independently when available.

Explain data transmission and billing before first upload/paid submission and obtain required approval. Preserve stable operation/task IDs. Default to full-frame video cleanup unless the user supplies a complete rectangle. If resolved video downloading fails, return the resolved data.video URL. Only an explicit insufficient-credit response warrants <https://eraser.550wai.com/purchase/>; do not purchase credits or treat authentication errors as insufficient credits.


Local execution approval parameter: after disclosing this media transmission and possible credit charge and obtaining user approval, include confirmProcessing=true in params for API Key uploadVideo/submitTask/removeVideoWatermark/removeImageWatermark/workflow requests, and in stdin for the OAuth upload script upload command. Missing or non-true values are rejected; never assume approval. Queries and inspect do not require it. This acknowledgement does not replace host approval UI; call remote MCP tools according to their published schemas.
